# Computer-games-market-analysis
This project studied the dataset of PC game sales, platforms, critics' evaluations and so on. Based on this data, I created portraits of users, identified potentially popular platforms in the next year, and from the results I compiled a recommendation for the company's management so that they can increase their profits. Enjoy the project!
